<p>2011 &amp; 2012 has been a big year for vapourware and this is no exception. This has been rumoured to be in development since the release of the iPad, and now it's real.</p>
<p>I preordered my iPad before I heard any information on how restrictive it's OS would be. One of the reasons I took that risk was that I knew that this was going to blow Jazz Mutant's Lemur right out of the water.</p>
<p />
<div>And it did. In all ways hardware and price point, it was amazing. The software wasn't / isn't there yet. The next best thing for controller interfaces has been&nbsp;<a href="http://hexler.net/software/touchosc">TouchOSC</a>, which I've been using for a few years. And don't get me wrong, it's a great product, but there's something to say about the Lemur's interface modules and physics engine that I don't think any other iOS app has come close to touching. Hearing about this release has pretty much got me giggling like a school girl in a taffy store.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I can't wait to dust off my old Lemur patches and blow your minds. You should be excited. You will be excited.</div>
