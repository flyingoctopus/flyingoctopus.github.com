Did you ever have this problem after installing OS 10.7 Lion?&nbsp;<p /><p /><div>[[posterous-content:nmmHhKt1CGXDo9iHeol7]]</div><p /><p /><div>Yeah&nbsp;<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3191083?start=120&amp;tstart=0">so did everyone else</a>&nbsp;who had a mid-2010 MacBook Pro with NVIDIA GeFroce GT's including me. As a VJ, I cant tell you how nervous I was every time I had to project some stuff using my now unreliable laptop. Fortunately, Apple has released a long overdue video driver fix!
