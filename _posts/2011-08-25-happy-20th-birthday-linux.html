<p>Today, Linux has been in existence for 7,305 days. Today, Linus Benedict Torvalds posted the following message in the&nbsp;<em>comp.os.minix </em>&nbsp;thread:</p>

<div><span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><br /> From: <a href="mailto:torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI">torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI</a>(Linus Benedict Torvalds) Newsgroups: comp.os.minix Subject: What would you like to see most in minix? Summary: small poll for my new operating system Message-ID: &lt;<a href="mailto:1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI">1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI</a>&gt; Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT Organization: University of Helsinki Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things). I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-) Linus (<a href="mailto:torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi">torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi</a>) PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(. </span></div>

<div>Be in awe, because this was the day that the world changed. Happy anniversary to one of the greatest technical communities of all time. And thanks for all the fish.</div>
