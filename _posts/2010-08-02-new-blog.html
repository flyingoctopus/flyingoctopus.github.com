<p>Hello internet! If you followed my now defunct blog, you would know that I havent posted in over a year, and even when I did, over the last three years those posts were few and far between. This has been for a few reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p />
<div>1) I work for Microsoft, and anything I do there I cant talk about, and right now, most of my life consists of doing lots of things for them.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>2) The 'blog' isn't quick enough. I tweet like a maniac, but thats because I have many windows of time that can spare 140 characters or less. But what about '140 characters or more'?</div>
<p />
<div>&nbsp;Thats what I see this fulfilling. Slightly more meat that twitter, but it isnt the classically verbose blog that I once maintained. This is the perfect balance between brainfarts and insights. Enjoy!</div>
