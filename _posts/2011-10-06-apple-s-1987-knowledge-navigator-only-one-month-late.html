            <p>In 1987, Apple released this concept video for <strong>Knowledge Navigator</strong>, a voice-based assistant combined with a touchscreen tablet computer. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Based on the dates mentioned in the Knowledge Navigator video, it takes place on <strong>September 16, 2011</strong>.  The date on the professor's calendar is September 16, and he's looking for a 2006 paper written "about five years ago," setting the year as 2011. </p>

<p>And this morning, at the iPhone keynote, Apple announced <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/04/apple-announces-voice-activated-siri-assistant-feature-for-ios-5/">Siri</a>, a natural language-based voice assistant, would be built into iOS 5 and a core part of the new iPhone 4S.</p>

<p>So, <em>24 years ago</em>, Apple predicted a complex natural-language voice assistant built into a touchscreen Apple device, and was <em>less than a month off</em>.</p>
