<p><strong>Talk Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Vincent will be discussing what  music, video/installation art, hackspaces, and the maker movement all  have in common. He will explore the parallels between connecting  &lsquo;software libraries &amp; hardware&rsquo; and connecting &lsquo;people and  communities&rsquo; and how these points can benefit and accelerate every piece  involved. &nbsp;He will also offer examples of how tribes can help you  progress your field of multi-media work in both utilizing other fields  and by offering to help for others that want to grow as well.</p>
