Since I did the initial Mac OS X port, I’ve had very, very sporadic communications with the author <a href="http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/">Nasca Octavian Paul</a> about it.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of versioning.  Paul started a <a href="https://github.com/paulnasca/paulstretch_cpp">github repository</a>, but it hasn’t been updated since March.  It’s currently at version 2.2.2, but the only difference between 2.2-2 and 2.2-1 is that the version number it reports has changed.</p>
<p>At any rate, today I did a new build which is 1) OS X 10.6 (forward compatible with Lion, but perhaps not backwards compatible to Leopard or Tiger) 2) Up to date build, incorporating all of Paul’s changes.  I also spent some time playing with it to make sure it works properly.</p>
<p>You can download it here: <a href="http://www.cornwarning.com/xfer/PaulStretch-2.2.2-OSX-10.6.dmg">http://www.cornwarning.com/xfer/PaulStretch-2.2.2-OSX-10.6.dmg</a></p>
<p>It also has the latest refinements of the build scripts used to build PaulStretch from source.  I use <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, which is <a href="http://www.kitware.com">Kitware’s</a> cross-platform build tool.  CMake keeps getting smarter, and my CMake recipe for PaulStretch will download all the prerequisite libraries, build them, and then download the PaulStretch source, build it, and generate an Apple App Bundle.</p>
<p>And CMake really is cross-platform — the same build recipe will work unmodified on Linux (which I have tested) and possibly on Windows (which I haven’t tried).</p>
<p>If you still have a PowerPC Mac, you can try using <a href="http://www.cornwarning.com/xfer/PaulStretch-OSX-PPC.dmg">http://www.cornwarning.com/xfer/PaulStretch-OSX-PPC.dmg</a> which a friend of mine built, but it isn’t the most recent version of PaulStretch.</p>

    <p>I'm more excited than a schoolgirl in a taffy store. And so should you.</p></div>
