<p>Well now you can thanks to the <a href="http://www.magma.com/thunderbolt.asp" target="_blank">Thunderbolt Expansion Chassis</a> from Magma. If this is true, then there is no reason for me to own a MacBook Pro at all now.</p>
<p>I would buy a new MacBook Air with a Thunderbolt port, I would then pimp my Magma enclosure out with an array of NVidia cards and additional firewire 800 and usb ports, and maybe some storage. And thats just my setup.</p>
<p>I also envision a day where a Mac Mini could be used for installations, which was impossible before due to the Mini's weak graphics cards. This is going to be awesome guys. Frickin' awesome.</p>
<p>Now all Apple needs is to implement a BIOS&hellip;</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Update</span>: The Mac Mini <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html" target="_blank">already has Thunderbolt</a> (<em>thanks konobi!</em>). I think I have a nerd boner.</p>
