<p>I&rsquo;m a Canadian.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a quiet bunch; prone to enjoying hockey, drinking stronger beer than our friends south of the border, and lovers of fries smothered in cheese curds and gravy.</p>
<p>We also, apparently, have an inferiority complex when it comes to being evil dirt bags, because we&rsquo;ve decided to pass our very own version of SOPA up here.</p>
<p>Only better*</p>
<p>Meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_Canada#Bill_C-11">Bill-C11</a>. Formerly Bill C-32. (I think they thought if they made the number lower people would care less about it?)</p>
<p>Or as we call it up here; Her Royal Majesty V, Zzzzzzz</p>
<p>We like our politics dry up here.</p>
<p>But, as&nbsp;innocuous as it sounds, C-11 does a whole lot that SOPA did with a few extra twists you might not find in the Wikipedia write-up.</p>
<p>Like your PVR? You can&rsquo;t keep it under C-11.</p>
<p>Like ripping CDs to your iPod? Say bye-bye.</p>
<p>Hey, do you want to be able to unlock your $500 smartphone and take it to a provider less dedicated to violating your wallet? That won&rsquo;t be allowed either.</p>
<p>Did you get accused of internet piracy but no evidence has been presented and a trial date hasn&rsquo;t even been set? Under C-11 your ISP will now be forced to terminate your internet access.</p>
<p>And people say that governments can&rsquo;t be bought.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to get Google or Wikipedia to go dark up here. We don&rsquo;t have as robust a tech industry to act as a public counterbalance to entertainment industry interests. We have a Prime Minister (that&rsquo;s &nbsp;French for Dear Leader under the current regime) who doesn&rsquo;t give a suckling goat what the people think about his policies.</p>
<p>But we do have a lot more recourse in our political system to make politicians pay than our Yankee brethren do. (Yes I know I just insulted everyone south of the Mason Dixon line. I&rsquo;m sorry. You trying caring about foreign geographical terminology when every person you&rsquo;ve ever met from a particular country still thinks it&rsquo;s the height of hilarity to ask if you live in an igloo.) We have things like votes of no confidence that can really bugger up a sitting House member&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re Canadian, or you&rsquo;re friends with a Canadian, or you just really like bacon, click the link at the bottom of this article and share it with as many people as you can.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t afford to lose on this one, Canada.</p>
<p>Besides&hellip;</p>

<p>And he would know.</p>
<p>*And by better, I mean shockingly, horrifyingly worse.</p>

<p>For those who are complaining that C-11 as written isn&rsquo;t SOPA-like enough to warrant this comparison, please read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6257/125/">http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6257/125/</a> before commenting. Things have changed drastically with respect to this bill in the last week; the really ugly stuff (which has been publicly discussed by members of the C-11 committee.) is in the unpublished modifications in the wake of SOPA&rsquo;s defeat stateside.</p>
