Funny how things come full circle no? <p /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YOx-lsaAfSo?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe><p /> Apple Gatekeeper is going to require all apps to register with Apple. This whitelist approach is reminiscent of the iOS app approval model, which is closed and stifling. <p /> It seems like the next OS after Mountain Lion is going to be the one that will cause me to abandon the Apple platform all together. Windows has and always will be garbage, so that means Linux is going to need to find a way to attract more UX/UI designers and start using vector fonts before I am forced re-learn the abacus.
