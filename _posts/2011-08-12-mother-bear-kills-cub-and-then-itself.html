<p>The Chinese media has reported on an extraordinary account of a mother bear saving her cub from a life of torture by strangling it and then killing itself.</p>
<p>The bears were kept in a farm located in a remote area in&nbsp;the North-West of China.&nbsp;The bears&nbsp;on the farm had their gall bladders milked daily for 'bear bile,' which is used as a remedy in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).</p>
<p>It was reported that the bears are kept in tiny cages known as 'crush cages', as the bears have no room to manoeuvre and are literally crushed.</p>
<p>The bile is harvested by making a permanent hole or fistula in the bears' abdomen and gall bladder.</p>
<p>As the hole is never closed, the animals are suspect to various infections and diseases including tumours, cancers and death from peritonitis.</p>
<p>The bears are fitted with an iron vest, as they often try to kill themselves by hitting their stomach as they are unable to bear the pain.</p>
<p>A person who was on the farm in place of a friend witnessed the procedures and told Reminbao.com that they were inhumane.</p>
<p>The witness also claimed that a mother bear broke out its cage when it heard its cub howl in fear before a worker punctured its stomach to milk the bile.</p>
<p>The workers ran away in fear when they saw the mother bear rushing to its cub's side.</p>
<p>Unable to free the cub from its restraints, the mother hugged the cub and eventually strangled it.</p>
<p>It then dropped the cub and ran head-first into a wall, killing itself.</p>
<p>Many TCM practitioners have denounced the use of bear bile in their treatment as there are cheaper herbs and synthetics that can be used in its place.</p>
<p>Bear bile is traditionally used to remove 'heat' from the body as well as treat high fever, liver ailments and sore eyes.</p>
