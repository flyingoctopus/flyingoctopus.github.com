<div>My favourite part of Siggraph 2011 just emailed me, glad we're staying in touch. My <a href="http://monome.org">Monome</a> demo was not the only grid of buttons in The Studio, in fact, the other buttons were also knobs. Fucking genius.</div><p /><div><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6bXkqFeYZas?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe></div><p /><div>Note that they designed the solenoid valves for the height attenuation themselves from scratch. Oh and it's an atmega 328 in there.</div>
