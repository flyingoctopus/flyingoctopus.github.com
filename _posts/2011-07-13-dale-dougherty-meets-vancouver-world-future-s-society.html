 <div><span>This past weekend, Vancouver was fortunate enough to be graced by the presence of</span>&nbsp;Dale Dougherty,&nbsp;<span>one of the co-founders of O'Reilly Media and the founder and publisher of&nbsp;</span>O'Reilly's Make Magazine. He is an awesome guy, and I have to say that the talk he gave at the World Future's Society inspired me so much, my optimism for our future has been revitalized to Pre-space-shuttle-retirement levels. He reminded me that the future is what you make of it, so hurry up an start Making!@#!</div><p /><div><span><object height="375" width="500"> <param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fvincentpants%2Fsets%2F72157627187090510%2F%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fvincentpants%2Fsets%2F72157627187090510%2F&set_id=72157627187090510&jump_to=" /></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" /></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /></param><embed src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="375" flashvars="offsite=true&lang=en-us&page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fvincentpants%2Fsets%2F72157627187090510%2F%2Fshow%2F&page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fvincentpants%2Fsets%2F72157627187090510%2F&set_id=72157627187090510&jump_to=" width="500"></embed></object></span></div>
