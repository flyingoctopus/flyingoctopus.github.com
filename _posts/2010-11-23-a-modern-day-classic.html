<div>Check out this email I found today in my self hosted mail accounts. A modern day classic.</div><br /><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div style="">Dear Friend,</div><p /><div style="">My name is Tony and I am a trader in the foreign exchange market</div><div style="">(Forex.)&nbsp; Every trade I make involves selling one currency and buying</div><div style="">another.&nbsp; For example, if I believe the euro will gain against the</div><div style="">dollar, I will sell dollars and buy euros.</div><p /><div style="">After years of study and practice, I am now able to consistently make</div><div style="">a profit.&nbsp; I am now confident enough to accept funds from friends and</div><div style="">family and provide them with good returns.</div><p /><div style="">My goal is to make enough profit from their initial investment that I</div><div style="">can pay the entire investment amount plus 10% back to them in monthly</div><div style="">payments each year – for as long as I am able.&nbsp; I feel confident that</div><div style="">I can provide these levels of return for at least three years – and</div><div style="">hopefully many more.</div><p /><div style="">For example, if you invest $10,000, you would receive twelve monthly</div><div style="">payments the first year totaling $11,000.&nbsp; The second year I’ll</div><div style="">increase the payments an additional 10% to account for cost of living</div><div style="">increases.&nbsp; In year two you would receive twelve monthly payments</div><div style="">totaling $12,100.&nbsp; In year three you would receive twelve monthly</div><div style="">payments totaling $13,310.</div><p /><div style="">In the above example, on your initial $10,000 investment, you would</div><div style="">have been paid $36,410 over three years.&nbsp; This level of return is</div><div style="">virtually impossible to get from any other investment available to the</div><div style="">average person.</div><p /><div style="">I will make every effort to provide you with the above return on your</div><div style="">money indefinitely, even beyond three years.&nbsp; Because my investments</div><div style="">have a level of risk, which I keep minimized, I cannot guarantee that</div><div style="">you I will be able to provide these high returns.</div><p /><div style="">I do take the responsibility though of making sure you do not lose any</div><div style="">money.&nbsp; That makes this a safe investment for you.&nbsp; You may request</div><div style="">your initial investment back in full at any time!</div><p /><div style="">I know of individuals who have taken loans out from retirement savings</div><div style="">or their house and have invested the money and made much higher</div><div style="">returns than they could find anywhere else.</div><p /><div style="">If you are interested, I accept funds for investment via PayPal only</div><div style="">at this time.&nbsp; Using PayPal protects both of us.&nbsp; My PayPal e-mail</div><div style="">address for accepting funds is <a href="mailto:forexweatherman@gmail.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline ; color: #063ff4;">forexweatherman@gmail.com</span></a>&nbsp; I ask that</div><div style="">the minimum investment amount be $1,000 as it is difficult for me to</div><div style="">make good profits on lesser amounts.</div><p /><div style="">Sincerely Yours,</div><p /><div style="">Tony C.</div></blockquote>
