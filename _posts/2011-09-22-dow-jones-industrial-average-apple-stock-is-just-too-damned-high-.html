<p>Putting <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AAPL:US" title="Get Quote">Apple Inc. (AAPL)</a> in the <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/dow-jones-industrial-average/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> would mean the benchmark gauge would get 22 percent of its value from the iPhone maker, too much influence even for the world&rsquo;s largest company, according to Bespoke Investment Group LLC.</p>
<p>Apple, trading at about $420, would have the largest weighting in the 30-company measure because Dow companies are ranked by stock price, not market value. Replacing Kraft Foods Inc. with the Cupertino, California-based company would drive <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=IBM:US" title="Get Quote">International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)</a> down to 9.2 percent from 11.6 percent of the Dow, Bespoke said in a report today. IBM closed at $173.13 yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hold your breath,&rdquo; Bespoke, based in Harrison, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/">New York</a>, wrote in a note to clients, citing speculation today that Apple may enter the Dow. &ldquo;If the stock were added to the index without a split in the shares, it would have a disproportionate weight in the index, making it more like the Dow Jones Industrial Apple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Silverman, a spokesman for Dow Jones Indexes, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Apple had its weighting in another benchmark measure, the Nasdaq-100 Index, reduced this year. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. cut the company&rsquo;s share of the Nasdaq-100 Index to about 12.33 percent from 20.49 percent. While the exchange imposed rules in 1998 preventing the biggest corporations in the index from having too much sway, Apple&rsquo;s market capitalization was too small to qualify for a curb at the time.</p>
<p>Shares of Apple jumped 91-fold between 1997, when the San Francisco Chronicle said <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a> would be appointed interim chief executive officer, and his resignation in August. The company&rsquo;s market value has surged to about $384 billion.</p>
