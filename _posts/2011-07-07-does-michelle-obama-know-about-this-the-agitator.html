<p><a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/julie-bass-of-oak-park-faces-misdemeanor-charge-for-vegetable-garden-20110630-wpms">Oak Park, Michigan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their front yard was torn up after replacing a sewer line, so instead of replacing the dirt with grass, one Oak Park woman put in a vegetable garden and now the city is seeing green.</p>
<p>The list goes on: fresh basil, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes, cumbers and more all filling five large planter boxes that fill the Bass family&rsquo;s front yard.</p>
<p>Julie Bass says, &ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;re minding our own business, doing something not ostentatious and certainly not obnoxious or nothing that is a blight on the neighborhood, so we didn&rsquo;t think people would care very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But some cared very much and called the city. The city then sent out code enforcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They warned us at first that we had to move the vegetables from the front, that no vegetables were allowed in the front yard. We didn&rsquo;t move them because we didn&rsquo;t think we were doing anything wrong, even according to city code we didn&rsquo;t think we were doing anything wrong. So they ticketed us and charged me with a misdemeanor,&rdquo; Bass said . . .</p>
<p>City code says that all unpaved portions of the site shall be planted with grass or ground cover or shrubbery or other suitable live plant material. Tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers are what Basses see as suitable.</p>
<p>However, Oak Park&rsquo;s Planning and Technology Director Kevin Rulkowski says the city disagrees. He says, &ldquo;If you look at the dictionary, suitable means common. You can look all throughout the city and you&rsquo;ll never find another vegetable garden that consumes the entire front yard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what <em>is</em> suitable? From <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/julie-bass-of-oak-park-faces-misdemeanor-charge-for-vegetable-garden-20110630-wpms">another local news report</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>&nbsp;. . . &nbsp;we asked Rulkowski why it&rsquo;s not suitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look at the definition of what suitable is in Webster&rsquo;s dictionary, it will say common. So, if you look around and you look in any other community, what&rsquo;s common to a front yard is a nice, grass yard with beautiful trees and bushes and flowers,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God forbid your yard doesn&rsquo;t include beautiful trees, bushes and flowers. It&rsquo;s your job, Oak Park citizens, to give Kevin Rulkowski pretty things to look at. <a href="http://oakparkhatesveggies.wordpress.com/">According to Bass&rsquo;s blog</a>, she&rsquo;s demanding her right to a jury trial. So the city plans to throw the book at her.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>our attorney spoke to the prosecutor today. (for the record, my crush on him is totally finished after today.)</p>
<p>his position: they are going to take this all the way.</p>
<p>officially, this means i am facing 93 days in jail if they win.</p>
<p>no joke.</p>
