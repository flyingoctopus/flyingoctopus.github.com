<p>
New release has just added native swf playback support in 10.6 (f*cking sh*t), but this is huge!</p>

<p>WHAT NOW RESOLUME?!</p>
<p /> 

<blockquote><div>
		
added full support for playing back flash files (10.6 only for now). interactive flash files are supported; performance is damn good for flash, but flash is still painfully slow and incapable of scaling as elegantly as other media types.

LFO plugin can record from data sources
