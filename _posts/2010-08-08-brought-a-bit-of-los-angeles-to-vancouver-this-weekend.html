<p />
<div>The next day we walked from my house to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aupetitchavignol.com/" class="l">Au Petit Chavignol</a>&nbsp;and had&nbsp;fondu and a really good local BC wine! So awesome!</div>

<div>What a wonderful surprise! Oh, and my grandmother is badass if you didn't already know. I mean, look at her juggle!:

<div style="text-align: left;">All in all, it was a great time, and I'm so incredibly happy that they made an impromptu visit. Hopefully they can do it again soon, I think they had a good time, and being from California, they loved the rainy weekend.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">K, now time to catch up on my coding, so much to do! Next post == reliving the demoscene with&nbsp;<a href="http://js1k.com/home">1kjs</a></div>
